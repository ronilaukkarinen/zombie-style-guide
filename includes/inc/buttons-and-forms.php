<h2 class="panel-title">Buttons &amp; forms</h2>

<p>The primary button is used for important actions, and should only appear once on a page. It's the default button styling. Secondary buttons are for less important actions.</p>

<button>Primary button</button>
<button class="secondary">Secondary button</button>

<p>Subtle buttons are for very small actions, like clearing filters, where we need something that just barely looks like a button.</p>

<button class="subtle">Subtle button</button>
